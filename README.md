#### I'm a full stack developer (backend and iOS) who leans heavily on Python/Django/Swift(UI).

###### BACKEND
- 🔭 I’m big on documentation. [Code, tests](https://github.com/nceruchalu/gravvy-server/blob/master/gravvy/apps/account/models.py) and even [API endpoints](https://jolly.cards/api/v1/).
- 🤔 I like thinking of ways to get data across the stack, from the client/edge to the backend to the cloud.
  + Protocol buffers, timescale, and AWS-everything are my go-tos.
  + I used all these in my attempt at beating Tesla to the solar power market in Africa: https://iongenny.com
- 💬 Ask me about databases. I'm a big fan of Postgres, mostly because the plugins make my life easy.

###### IOS
- 🌱 I used to be all-in on [Objective-C](https://github.com/nceruchalu/gravvy-ios) but then SwiftUI came into the scene and I'm now all about Swift.
- 🔭 I really believe that everyone deserves a daily dose of joy. So I keep on attempting to reinvent e-cards for a mobile-first world. [JollyCards](https://jolly.cards) is my latest iteration.
- 💬 Ask me about CallKit and SIP trunking. These are things I learned when building my own personal calling app. [RingPad](https://ringpad.co) is a lot like Google Voice but uses my actual phone number so my recipients know who's calling.

###### OTHER FUN PROJECTS
- 💛 iOS apps that monitor hearts, open apartment gates, manage salon bookings.
- 💌 Web apps that simplify email marketing, annotate images used in ML pipelines, manage shopping rewards.
- 🛍 E-commerce ETL pipelines.
